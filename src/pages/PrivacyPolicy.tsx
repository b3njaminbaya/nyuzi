                        reclaimed textiles in Kenya. This policy applies to everyone who visits nyuzi.co.ke,
                        donates an item, applies to partner with us, or buys something in the marketplace —
                        whether or not you create an account.

                        100% secure, but we design every feature to minimize what's exposed and to whom.
