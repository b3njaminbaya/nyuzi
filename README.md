# Nyuzi

**Nyuzi** (Swahili for "thread") is a circular-fashion business operating in
the Kenyan market, built and owned by Benjamin Mweri Baya. It connects three
groups of people around one idea — that textiles don't have to end up in a
landfill: donors who give away clothing, shoes, and accessories they no
longer need; upcycling partners who turn those materials into new products;
and buyers who shop those products with full visibility into the
environmental impact and, in many cases, the exact donation a piece was made
from.

This repository contains the complete Nyuzi application: a React/TypeScript
frontend and a Supabase backend (Postgres, Auth, Storage, and Edge
Functions), covering everything from donation intake through checkout,
payment, fulfillment, and post-purchase engagement. It is live at
**https://nyuzi.vercel.app**.

## Project status

Nyuzi is a live, operating business, not a demo or a portfolio piece. Every
feature described below is backed by a real database with row-level security
enforced at the data layer, real payment processing, real transactional
email, and has been verified end-to-end with automated regression testing
before being considered complete. The project went through two structured
phases of work: a Production Readiness pass (storage, email, inventory
integrity, legal compliance, deployment configuration) followed by a full
roadmap of customer- and admin-facing features, followed by a security
audit and remediation pass. The only roadmap item not yet built is a
WhatsApp-based donation channel, which was deliberately deferred because it
depends on a Meta Business Account and verified phone number that only the
business owner can set up — see the Roadmap section below. M-Pesa payment
processing is implemented but not yet activated in production — see
`DEPLOYMENT.md` for the Daraja credentials and callback-security setup
required before enabling it.

## Core features

### Donations

Anyone — signed in or as a guest — can submit a donation describing an item's
title, category, and condition, with an optional pickup request (a specific
date and address, not just a boolean). Donors can attach photos, which are
compressed client-side and uploaded to a private Supabase Storage bucket
accessible only to the donor and Nyuzi admins through short-lived signed
URLs. An earlier version of this feature included an on-device AI
category-suggestion model; it was removed after review found it added a
multi-megabyte download for donors on mobile data without meaningfully
reducing the effort of picking a category by hand.

### Marketplace and checkout

The marketplace supports full-text search, category and price-range
filtering, and sorting, all executed server-side with trigram indexing so
performance holds up as the catalog grows. Each product has its own detail
page showing description, stock, ratings, and — where applicable — the
donation-to-product traceability story described below. Checkout supports
both signed-in and guest customers, and payment is handled through M-Pesa's
Daraja API (STK Push); if M-Pesa isn't configured in a given environment,
checkout automatically and transparently falls back to a manual-payment
flow rather than breaking.

### Inventory integrity

Stock is enforced atomically at the database level: creating an order locks
and decrements the relevant product rows inside a single transaction, so two
customers checking out the last unit of an item concurrently cannot both
succeed. If an order later fails payment or is cancelled, the reserved stock
is automatically returned. Direct table access that would bypass this
guarantee is revoked at the database grant level, not just hidden in the UI.

### Order fulfillment and shipping

Orders move through a full lifecycle — pending payment, paid, shipped,
fulfilled, or cancelled/failed — and a shipped order always carries a
carrier and tracking number, set together in a single atomic action so the
two can never go out of sync. Customers see live tracking information on
their order status page, and receive an email the moment their order ships.

### Donation-to-product traceability

Where a marketplace product was made from one or more specific donations,
its product page tells that story: which donations, what category they
were, and when they came in — for example, a tote bag built from jackets
donated in March. This is exposed to shoppers through a narrowly scoped
database function that reveals only the minimum needed to tell the story,
without ever loosening the privacy of the underlying donations table.

### Product reviews and ratings

Signed-in customers can leave a star rating and written review for any
product. New reviews are held in a pending-review queue and only become
publicly visible once an admin approves them — the same moderation pattern
used for donations and partner applications elsewhere in the platform.
Reviews from customers who actually purchased the item they're reviewing
are marked as verified purchases, computed from real order history rather
than trusted from the client.

### Rewards and referrals

Every account has a unique, shareable referral link. When someone signs up
through that link and their first order is paid, both the new customer and
the person who referred them receive Nyuzi store credit automatically,
redeemable against a future order's total at checkout. The reward is
granted exactly once per referred account, guarded at the database level
against being triggered again by later purchases.

### Transactional email

Order confirmations, payment receipts, shipping notifications, donation
acknowledgements, partner application updates, and referral reward
notifications are all sent automatically through a dedicated email
pipeline built on Resend, triggered directly by database events rather than
by client-side code — so an email goes out even if a customer closes the
tab immediately after checkout. Every send attempt, successful or not, is
recorded in an admin-visible email log for troubleshooting.

### Admin panel

A dedicated admin area (`/admin`) provides full operational control:
product and category management, an approval queue for donations and
partner applications, order management with shipment tracking, review
moderation, a real-time dashboard of key metrics, a complete audit log of
every administrative action taken on the platform, and role management —
promoting or demoting a user's access level is a UI action, not something
that requires running SQL by hand.

### Security posture

Every table is protected by Postgres row-level security, with
security-definer functions used deliberately and narrowly wherever a
feature needs to safely cross a privacy boundary (for example, showing a
product's donation provenance, or an admin's user list with email
addresses, without granting blanket read access to the underlying tables).
While building the admin role management feature, a genuine pre-existing
privilege-escalation vulnerability was discovered and fixed: the profiles
table's update policy had no `WITH CHECK` clause, meaning any signed-in
user could, in principle, call the Supabase client directly from a browser
console and set their own role to admin. That path is now closed at the
database grant level.

## Technology stack

The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, and Vite, styled with
Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components built on Radix primitives, using an
HSL design-token system for theming. Routing is handled by React Router
with route-level code splitting, forms are managed with React Hook Form and
validated with Zod, and the web app is additionally packaged for iOS and
Android through Capacitor.

The backend is entirely Supabase: Postgres for data storage with row-level
security as the primary access-control mechanism, Supabase Auth for
authentication, Supabase Storage for product images and private donation
photos, and Deno-based Edge Functions for M-Pesa payment initiation and
callback handling and for sending transactional email.

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Copy the environment template and fill in your Supabase project's public
credentials (found in the Supabase dashboard under Settings → API):

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs the app on `http://localhost:8080`.

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview a production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Sync the native iOS/Android projects after a build, if you're working on
the mobile packaging:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

## Environment variables and secrets

The frontend only ever needs two public, non-secret values, set in
`.env.local`: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Access
control is enforced by row-level security policies in the database, not by
keeping the anon key secret, so it's safe to ship in client code.

Everything else — the M-Pesa Daraja credentials, the Resend API key, and
the internal webhook secret used to authenticate calls from the database to
the email-sending Edge Function — lives exclusively as Supabase Edge
Function secrets, configured with `supabase secrets set` and never
committed to this repository. `supabase/PHASE_2_EMAIL_SETUP.md` documents
exactly how the email pipeline is configured, and `DEPLOYMENT.md` covers
the full production deployment checklist, including the Supabase Auth
redirect-URL configuration that production password resets depend on.

## Database and backend

All schema changes live as sequential, numbered SQL migrations under
`supabase/migrations/`, intended to be run in order through the Supabase
SQL editor or CLI. Each migration is self-documenting: every non-obvious
design decision — why a table is structured a particular way, why a
function is security-definer, why a policy exists — is explained in a
comment directly above it, since that context doesn't belong anywhere else
and would otherwise be lost.

A few patterns recur throughout the schema and are worth understanding
before extending it. Guest checkout and guest donations mean several tables
accept a null `user_id`, so row-level policies are written to treat
"anonymous, and matching by row identity" as a valid case. Wherever a
feature needs to read across a privacy boundary — showing an order to its
owner without a session, showing a product's donation history publicly,
showing an admin the email address behind a user ID — that crossing
happens through a small, purpose-built, security-definer SQL function
rather than by loosening the underlying table's policy, so the blast radius
of any single exposure stays as small as possible.

## Deployment

The frontend deploys as a static Vite build to Vercel; `vercel.json`
configures the SPA rewrite needed for client-side routing to work on direct
links and page refreshes. `DEPLOYMENT.md` is the authoritative deployment
guide, covering build settings, required environment variables, the
Supabase Auth production configuration step, and a post-deploy smoke-test
checklist. The Supabase backend (database and Edge Functions) is deployed
independently via the Supabase CLI and dashboard.

## Roadmap

The platform's core product roadmap is complete, with one deliberate
exception: a WhatsApp-based donation channel for the Kenyan market, which
was scoped but not built. Full automation would require the business to set
up and verify a Meta Business Account and a dedicated WhatsApp Business
phone number — a real-world step only the business owner can take, with
cost implications beyond a certain volume — so it was deferred rather than
built against a placeholder. A zero-cost alternative (a "Chat on WhatsApp"
link with manual intake) remains available as a future option that requires
no external account setup at all.
